    "* * Since the values grow exponentialy, we want to keep them small from the beginning to make gradient descent work faster.\n",
    "* Note that we can also use $\\sqrt{x}$, $x^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$ and etc., not only powers greater that 0.\n",

    "* * Gradient descent will emphasize the coefficients that helps most to fit the data. The longer you run the training - the more significant they will become, compared to the rest.\n",
